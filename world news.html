                <div class="subHeading">The Dark Side of the Video Game Industry by Alex Czapski</div>
                <div class="article">
                    In 2022, the video game industry has become industrialised. Whilst some Indie games made by single, independent developers have taken off in recent years – namely “Stardew Valley”, created by Eric Barone, which generated well over 30 million dollars of revenue in its history – the market for video games remains widely monopolised by mammoth companies such as Electronic Arts (EA), Sony, Microsoft, and Epic Games, which release video games monthly, and often premium prices. EA alone has generated a total of 5.6 billion dollars in 2021, dwarfing the revenue of niche video games with ease. This overwhelming income, however, relies largely on the exploitation of a company’s employees and developers, who work on a suffocatingly tight schedule, during which overtime pay is rare, to agree with a studio’s overly ambitious expectations and release dates.

                    Video game companies have a brutal work culture, which expect employees to work up to 100 hours per week during their most busy periods: on average, that is over 14 hours daily. In a 2019 interview, an Epic Games employee exposed these inhumane working hours, reporting that “[They] hardly sleep… [They] have no energy to go out. Getting a weekend away from work is a major achievement”. A huge reason why such vicious working hours exist lies in the fundamental aspect of how Epic Games earns money from their video games. “Fortnite” Epic Games’ largest game, has made an astronomical amount of over $6 billion since its release in 2017. Despite this, “Fortnite” is free to play, and relies purely on micro transactions, which offer users in-game cosmetics such as ‘skins’ and comical dances. Therefore, in order for “Fortnite” to gain money, developers need to work endlessly in order to provide a constant influx of new content to retain gamers’ attention span, in the aim of users spending as much money as possible on these virtual items.

                    A further result of video game companies’ tight schedules is that, once these deadlines are met, many large companies are known to lay off a large proportion of their workforce. This is because, during in the creation of such games, in order to meet with impossible deadlines, it is necessary to hire more developers and workers to rush the game into completion. However, once deadlines are inevitably met, excess workers are no longer required. Without cause, major companies are know to fire large percentages of their workforce. This cheap pattern not only appears in a single company, but in almost all major video game manufacturers. A prime example of such behaviour took place in 2019, when Activision Blizzard fired 8% of its staff – 800 of its employs – without reason. This behaviour is repeatedly seen in major companies, where it is uncommon for Telltale Games, EA or even Microsoft to lay off hundreds of its employees at a time.

                    To conclude, the overwhelming demand for video games in this technologically consumed climate is provided almost solely via massive video game companies, and yet despite such mammoth income, they are unable to treat their own employees well, to the extent of forcing them to work 100 hour work weeks, at the risk of being fired should they fail, only for there to remain a large chance, that once they have met their deadline, they will be laid off none the less…

                <div class="subHeading">US BANS ABORTION IN STATES: Roe vs Wade </div>
                <div class="article">
                      Abortions have always been difficult to obtain in the United States of America, even during the time of European colonization where their laws were based on the European countries that colonized them. Even after independence was granted to the country in 1776, these laws still stayed present due to the strong presence that countries such as Britian still imposed on the land. Most states of America continued to apply English common law regarding controversial subjects such as abortion. As a result, abortions were not easy to obtain, but in the 1860s they became almost impossible to obtain in most of the states, with 30 states completely outlawing abortion, and only 4 keeping them legal upon request. This made it so that women were forced to carry a child they did not want to keep after its conception, and these laws continued to criminalize abortion in America. However, this would all change after the introduction of the Roe vs Wade case. 

Roe vs Wade is a case that was put forth in 1970 by Jane Roe against Henry Wade, who was the District Attorney of Dallas. Roe argued that a women should have the constitutional rights to have the choice as to have an abortion, due to the Texas laws deeming abortion illegal. This was declared in Roe’s favor in 1973 and declared that abortion would become a constitutional right of women and therefore became legal in more states 

This changed very recently on the 24th of June after the Supreme Court declared that the right to abortion was not "deeply rooted in this Nation's history or tradition” in the recent Roe vs Wade renewal case, where they overruled Roe in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization 

Now, abortions are harder than ever to obtain in the supposed “land of the free.” As a result of the overruling of the case, many states have passed trigger laws in the brief time after to effectively ban abortions there such as Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Utah, with the latter offering up to 15yrs imprisonment if an abortion happens. As a result, women are suffering heavily, not even being able to choose to have the child they may not want or be able to provide for, putting a huge strain on these women as their basic rights are being violated. They must travel hundreds of miles to different states where abortion is not criminalized in order to escape the inequitable laws that other states have laid down.  

This decision, which will mark American rights history, has already seen criticism and enraged responses from throughout the world. Countries such as Ireland are expressing the horror at the injustice that the Supreme Court has delivered, warning Americans of the story of those who died due to the rejection of a termination and advising them to prepare themselves for similar deaths. The entire world is wondering how this will affect women's rights and if America will continue on this shadowy path.

            <div class="article">
                  Eurovision 2022 raised much talent, as well as spirits, especially despite the tough times many are going through these past couple of years. Hosted by the previous winners, Italy, Eurovision was held in The Pala Alpitour in Turin which managed to cost them around €6.2 Million to prepare. 

The Acts 

Opening the show was Czech Republic with the song ‘Lights Off’ sung by We are Domi which ended up putting them only in 22nd place with a puny 38 points. But how did the ‘big 5’ compare to all the other acts? The big 5 are the patrons for the event and get automatic entrance into the grand finale of 25; they are UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. France was the first of the big 5 to perform and some might say it was quite underwhelming. Despite all the special effects to dampen the atrocity of the song, ‘Fulenn’, sang by Alvan and Ahez, the public decided that it was only worth 17 points and 24th place. Spain brought Chanel who sung ‘Slomo’ which blew the audience and the jury away and earned a spot on the podium at 3rd place with 459 collective points. Italy took a different approach than last year and rather than going full metalhead, they had Mahmood and Blanco performing ‘Brividi’, a somber song which scored them 268 points and 6th place. Germany put forward a solo guitarist, Malik Harris, singing ‘Rockstars’ which surprisingly only scored Germany 6 points and put them last out of the 25 acts. The final of the big 5, Sam Ryder (for the UK), sung his new hit ‘SPACE MAN’. His amazing talent and unbelievable vocals dazzled the audience and he rocketed into 2nd place with a huge 466 points; just getting the edge over Spain. Bear in mind, this year was the first time in 7 years the UK had received a single point, let alone finish in second place. A moment to certainly savor and cherish for the UK. 

The winner 

After 25 special performances, only one could win, and that was Ukraine. By. A. Landslide. They had the Kalush Orchestra singing ‘Stefania’ for which they were commended a whopping 631 points and the opportunity to host Eurovision 2023 in Ukraine next year. However, that is still an uncertainty due to the situation Ukraine is in currently and they are speculations that the 2nd place would host instead (which would be the UK), if Ukraine’s problems aren't resolved by then.  

Honorable mention 

Despite only finishing 10th in the competition, I believe (and many agree) with me that Norway's performance from Subwoolfer of “give that wolf a banana”. The hit was very popular amongst the public but unfortunately did not hit as well with the country's jury and their final score total was 182 points. Finlay Reid, an avid watcher of the Eurovision Song Contest, shared “Norway have had many great Eurovision songs over the last couple of years, such as Spirit in the Sky and Fallen Angel, but their new release for 2022 is pure brilliance. Everything from costumes to rhythm could not be better, and I cannot see, once again, why Norway have not won the competition.”
