                    <div class="article">Charles Leclerc managed to narrowly edge out Max Verstappen to win this years Austrian Grand Prix as Lewis Hamilton also found a spot on the podium. By taking the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday, Leclerc was able to leapfrog Max Verstappen's in the Drivers' Championship standings. Ferrari played their cards right in terms of strategy earning good points for the team at the Red Bull Ring, and the Italian team’s driver, seemed to simply outclass the Dutchman for the entirety of the race. Unfortunately for Ferrari, they were not able to secure the top two finish they wanted as Sainz was unable to finish the race due to an engine failure in the closing stages of the race as he battled with Verstappen before his car went up in flames in another unfortunate occurrence for the Spaniard. Leclerc almost threw his lead away at the end with his own issues in the form of his throttle pedal but luckily for Ferrari, he hung on to claim an incredibly impressive victory. Fan favourite Lewis Hamilton did well for himself similarly, managing to secure a podium finish from far back in his 8th position start.</div>

                   <div class="article">Wimbledon, Wimbledon, Wimbledon. How it always entertains us, with its tricks and turns and this year is no different. Rafael Nadal has withdrawn from the competition, ahead of his semi-final match against Nick Kyrgios, due to a severe abdominal injury. The Spaniard received a form of treatment during his quarter-final match, on the 6th July, against Taylor Fritz where he miraculously defied his pain to win in five sets. Nadal upon announcing his withdrawal stated that,”I have tried a lot of times in my career to keep going but it’s obvious the injury will get worse”. The 36 year-old confirmed to the public that he had a tear in his abdominal muscle, which prevents him from being able to play competitively for at least 2 matches. The 22-time Grand Slam champion had only been practicing at Wimbledon, away from the medias eye, on the morning on the 7th, before he ultimately called for a news conference. Nadal’s final message to reporters was,”The most important thing is happiness more than any titles. I can’t risk that match and stay 2 or 3 months out of the competition.” Kyrgios, who will now play Novak Djokovic or Cameron Norrie in Sunday’s final, added a heartfelt statement on social media, affirming his respect, declaring: “We all hope to see a healthy you soon.” We all wish Nadal the best in his recovery and look forward to seeing him return to the court. </div>
