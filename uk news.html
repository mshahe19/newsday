                    Monkeypox is a DNA virus. 18 new cases of monkeypox have been found in England by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), and one additional case has been found in Scotland. As of June 7th, 321 people have been confirmed in the UK as of this point. 305 confirmed cases have been reported so far, with 11 cases in Scotland, 2 cases in Northern Ireland, and 3 cases in Wales. Most cases that have been reported to date have involved males who have intercourse with other men, so even while this advice is applicable to everyone, we are urging these individuals to be aware of the signs, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. If you develop a blistered rash, you should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre right away if you: had spent the last three weeks in close proximity to someone who has or may have monkeypox (even if they have not been tested), had recently returned from a trip to West or Central Africa, a man who engages in male sex.

                    Dr Ruth Milton, Senior Medical Advisor at UKHSA said: “Monkeypox is a DNA virus. The majority of cases that have been reported to date have involved gay, bisexual, and males who have intercourse with other men, so even while this advise is applicable to everyone, we are urging these individuals to be aware of the signs, especially if they have recently had a new sexual partner. If you develop a blistered rash, you should call NHS 111 or a sexual health centre right away if you: had spent the last three weeks in close proximity to someone who has or may have monkeypox (even if they have not been tested), had recently returned from a trip to West or Central Africa, a man who engages in male sex.”

                    Health protection teams from the UKHSA are contacting individuals who are thought to be high-risk contacts of cases that have been confirmed and are encouraging those who have undergone risk assessments and are in good health to isolate at home for up to 21 days. In order to lower the likelihood of symptomatic infection and severe disease, UKHSA has additionally ordered more than 20,000 doses of the safe smallpox vaccine Imvanex (provided by Bavarian Nordic). This is being distributed to identified close contacts of persons who have been diagnosed with monkeypox.

                <div class="article">
                    Priti Patel recently announced that she is planning to deport hundreds of refugees to Rwanda, a small country in the continent of Africa. She calls this her ‘Rwandan Relocation Plan’ and decides to plough through with such a decision despite fierce opposition. One example being the Archbishop of Canterbury, who criticized the policy as ‘immoral’ and even Prince Charles said that the policy was ‘appalling’. Priti Patel also announces that she won’t actually be running for Tory leader, despite the recent announcement of the resignation of PM Boris Johnson, instead increasing her focus of boosting police force numbers and generally “controlling our borders”.
                    “As Home Secretary I have always put the security and safety of our country and the national interest first and my focus is to continue working to get more police on our streets, support our amazing security services to keep our country safe and control our borders”- Home Secretary Priti Patel.
                    With this, it’s also clear to say that there is no sign that Priti will be  running for PM anytime soon either.

                    The events that is the war between Ukraine and Russia are known worldwide and most of the world support the refugees that flee from their home country. Despite the Ukranian population having such a load to bear, they have shown great perseverance as they fight to keep their home nation striving. Life in Ukraine isn’t the same as Putin’s devious plans to annex the country result in the countless loss of lives.

                    As a response from Britain, Boris Johnson is expected to announce the uplift in the British Army to respond to the threat that is Vladimir Putin. It’s often referred to as their “1937 moment” (in reference to the upcoming years to World War II), but nevertheless, Britain is mobilising its	army not to provoke war, but just to prevent war as the current situation in Ukraine is ‘unprecedented’ (General Sanders from the British army).

                    Because of such a threat, Boris Johnson carves out a significant portion of money from his own defence secretary on the U. K’s ‘smoke and mirrors budget’. General Sanders has plans to further reduce the size of the British army from a target figure of 82,000 to 75,000, saying that Britain will have to persevere.

                    The war between Ukraine and Russia all began in the earlier months of 2022, specifically around February. Russian PM Vladimir Putin’s gave his casus belli because they were provoked by Ukraine threatening to join NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). This means that Ukraine can perform military practices in the country whilst making it very easy for them to invade Russia

            <div class="subHeading">THE RESIGNATION OF THE PM </div>
            <div class="article">
                After nearly 3 gruelling years, our PM, Boris Johnson, has finally resigned after the government made him resign on the grounds that he was ‘abusing power’. Unexpectedly, the vote of no confidence to confirm this is expected on Wednesday without any parliamentary time.

                A Labour spokesman said “Yet again the Tories are changing the rules to protect their own dodgy mates. All the Tory leadership candidates should denounce flagrant abuse of power to protect their own prime minister”, in response to this.

                However, on Monday, the newly established 1922 Committee confirmed that he would be staying in office until the 5th November. Naturally, the government is arguing that the vote is a waste of time as Boris has ‘already resigned’. Keir Starmer also said that it would be ‘intolerable to Britain’ if they let him ‘cling on until the 5th'. Since his resignation was announced, Boris has been appointing a number of unusual successors to the position, and is intending hand out resignation knighthoods and peerages to allies, examples being culture secretary Nathan Dorries, and, supposedly, his own father.

                To further expand upon this, Boris’s wife, Carrie Johnson said that 10 Downing Street felt ‘like a prison’. His sister, Rachel Johnson, also said farewell to her brother being PM, saying that Boris ‘wanted to become world king at two, and actually almost achieved that’ during her speech.
